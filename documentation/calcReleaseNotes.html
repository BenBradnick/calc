<h1 align="center">calc Release Notes</h1>

<h2 align="center">Release 2-4</h2>

This version is intended to build with EPICS base 3.14.6.

<ul>
<li><p>interp.c, interp.db, interp.adl - no longer supports spline
interpolation. Array length no longer limited to 2000 elements.  Added range
checking.  Now the number of elements must be specified at load time, with the
macro, N.  Polynomial order is now forced to be in [0..10].
<li><p>All databases have been converted to vdct.
<li><p>swait-record documentation added
<li><p>copy of Andy Foster's genSubManual.pdf included for user's convenience
</ul>

<h2 align="center">Release 2-3</h2>

<p align="left">This is the first release of the synApps calc module.
Version numbering for this module begins with 2.3 because this module
was split from version 2.2 of the std module, and I wanted to retain
the CVS histories of module contents.</p>

This version is intended to build with EPICS base 3.14.5.

Differences from software as previously released in std 2.2:
<ul>
<li><p>interp.c, interp.db, interp.adl - now supports spline and
polynomial interpolation.
<li><p>subAve.c - registry stuff
