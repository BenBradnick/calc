<dt><a href="aCalcoutRecord.html">aCalcoutRecord.html</a>
<dd>The aCalcout record is much like the calcout record in EPICS base, but it
supports array fields and calculations, and its output link can wait for completion.

<dt><a href="sCalcoutRecord.html">sCalcoutRecord.html</a>
<dd>The sCalcout record is much like the calcout record in EPICS base, but it
supports string fields and calculations, and its output link can wait for completion.

<dt><a href="transformRecord.html">transformRecord.html</a>
<dd>The transform record is sort of like 16 calcout records collected together
into a single record.  The 16 calc expressions use a common set of 16
value fields, but each calc expression writes to its own value field.

<dt><a href="swaitRecord.html">swaitRecord.html</a>
<dd>The swait record is much like the calcout record in EPICS base, but it
uses an older form of retargetable links, and its output link waits for completion.

<dt><a href="interp.README">interp.README</a><dd>Interpolation software.  Given
arrays X and Y, calculates y(x), where x is in the range min(Y)..max(Y).  The
arrays can be preloaded, or built at run time.

<h2 align="center">How to build and use</h2>
<ul>
<li>Edit <code>configure/RELEASE</code> to specify the paths to <b>EPICS base</b>, and to
other modules (<b>sscan</b> and <b>genSub</b>) that the <b>calc</b> module can use to
build specific pieces of itself.  If you don't have <b>sscan</b> or
<b>genSub</b>, comment the definitions out, and the <b>calc</b> module will adjust its
build accordingly.
<li>Run Gnu Make to build.
<li>Note that the <b>calc</b> module is not useful on its own, but only produces
code that can be used by other modules.  (A good example of a module that uses
the calc module is synApps' <b>xxx</b> module.) A module that uses <b>calc</b>
should include <code>calcSupport.dbd</code> into the <code>.dbd</code> file it
creates for loading into an ioc, or for export to other modules, and it should
link to <code>libcalc</code>.
</ul>
